<h1>Rising Cybercrime: Need for Digital Literacy</h1>
<p><i>By Dr. Anita Sharma | October 13, 2025</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">The recent bust of a major cybercrime ring in Delhi highlights a growing threat that affects millions of Indians. As our lives become increasingly digital, criminals are finding new ways to exploit technology and target unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p align="justify">The sophistication of these crimes is alarming. From phishing scams to identity theft, cybercriminals use advanced techniques that can fool even educated individuals. The elderly and those unfamiliar with technology are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p align="justify">While law enforcement agencies are doing commendable work in tracking down these criminals, prevention is equally important. We need a nationwide digital literacy campaign that educates citizens about online safety.</p>
<p align="justify">Simple precautions can prevent most cybercrimes: never share OTPs or passwords, verify caller identities before sharing information, use strong passwords, and be skeptical of too-good-to-be-true offers.</p>
<p align="justify">Schools and colleges should include cybersecurity awareness in their curriculum. Banks and financial institutions must invest in better security systems and customer education. Only through collective effort can we create a safer digital environment.</p>
