<h1>Drug Trafficking Network Exposed in Mumbai</h1>
<p><i>By Amit Verma | October 13, 2025 | 5:00 AM IST</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Mumbai Police's Narcotics Control Bureau busted a major drug trafficking network operating across Maharashtra. The operation led to the seizure of 50 kg of heroin worth Rs 150 crores and arrest of 12 individuals.</p>
<p align="justify">The network was smuggling drugs from international borders and distributing them through a sophisticated supply chain in major cities. Police conducted simultaneous raids at 15 locations across Mumbai, Pune, and Nashik.</p>
<p align="justify">The kingpin, identified as Salman Sheikh, had been operating the network for over five years. He used encrypted messaging apps and cryptocurrency for transactions to avoid detection.</p>
<p align="justify">"This is one of the biggest drug busts in recent years," said DCP Narcotics. "The network had connections with international drug cartels."</p>
<p align="justify">Police also seized luxury cars, cash worth Rs 2 crores, and fake documents. The accused have been booked under the NDPS Act and remanded to judicial custody.</p>
