<h1>Hit-and-Run Case: Driver Surrenders After CCTV Evidence</h1>
<p><i>By Neha Patel | October 13, 2025 | 4:00 AM IST</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">A 28-year-old man surrendered to police after CCTV footage clearly showed him fleeing the scene of a fatal hit-and-run accident in Gurgaon. The incident occurred three days ago when his speeding car hit a pedestrian crossing the road.</p>
<p align="justify">The victim, a 45-year-old shopkeeper, died on the spot. The driver, identified as Rohit Malhotra, fled immediately without helping the victim or informing authorities.</p>
<p align="justify">Police released CCTV footage on social media, which went viral. The clear images of the car and partial view of the driver led to his identification within 24 hours.</p>
<p align="justify">"The evidence was overwhelming. He realized he couldn't escape and decided to surrender," said investigating officer Inspector Rajesh Singh.</p>
<p align="justify">Malhotra has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving. His blood samples have been sent for alcohol testing. The victim's family has demanded strict punishment.</p>
