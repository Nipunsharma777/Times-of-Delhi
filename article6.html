<hr>
<p align="justify">Delhi Police solved a high-profile murder case with the arrest of a businessman's wife and her alleged lover. The victim, 52-year-old Suresh Gupta, was found dead in his Vasant Vihar residence last week.</p>
<p align="justify">Initial investigation suggested natural death, but autopsy revealed poisoning. Police then discovered that the victim's wife, Meena Gupta, was having an extramarital affair with family friend Anil Sharma.</p>
<p align="justify">The couple had been planning the murder for months. They mixed poison in the victim's evening tea and made it look like a heart attack. However, forensic evidence and phone records exposed their plot.</p>
<p align="justify">"They thought they had committed the perfect crime, but modern forensic techniques caught them," said DCP Crime. "Both have confessed to the murder."</p>
<p align="justify">The motive was to inherit the victim's property worth Rs 50 crores. Both accused have been charged with murder and conspiracy. The victim's family has expressed shock at the betrayal.</p>
