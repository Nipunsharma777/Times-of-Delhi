<h1>Serial Burglar Arrested After 3-Month Chase</h1>
<p><i>By Priya Sharma | October 13, 2025 | 7:00 AM IST</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Delhi Police finally nabbed a notorious serial burglar who had been evading capture for three months. The accused, identified as 32-year-old Ramesh Kumar, is suspected of committing over 40 burglaries across South Delhi residential areas.</p>
<p align="justify">Kumar was arrested from a hideout in Mehrauli after an intensive surveillance operation. Police recovered stolen jewelry worth Rs 25 lakhs, cash, and electronic items from his possession.</p>
<p align="justify">The breakthrough came when police analyzed CCTV footage from multiple crime scenes and identified a pattern in his modus operandi. Kumar would target houses during afternoon hours when residents were away.</p>
<p align="justify">"He was a professional burglar who studied his targets carefully before striking," said ACP Crime Branch. "We have been tracking him for months and finally caught him red-handed."</p>
<p align="justify">Several victims have identified their stolen items at the police station. Kumar has confessed to his crimes and is being interrogated about possible accomplices.</p>
