<h1>CBI Raids: Government Official Caught Taking Bribe</h1>
<p><i>By Vikram Singh | October 12, 2025 | 2:00 PM IST</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Central Bureau of Investigation conducted raids and caught a senior government official red-handed accepting Rs 10 lakh bribe. The accused, a Deputy Director in a central ministry, was demanding money to clear a pending file.</p>
<p align="justify">The trap was laid after the complainant, a businessman, approached CBI with evidence of bribe demand. CBI officials marked currency notes and recorded the entire transaction.</p>
<p align="justify">The official was arrested from his office while counting the bribe money. Searches at his residence revealed unaccounted cash worth Rs 2 crores and property documents showing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.</p>
<p align="justify">"This is a clear case of corruption and abuse of power," said CBI spokesperson. "We have evidence of multiple such transactions over the past two years."</p>
<p align="justify">The accused has been suspended from service pending investigation. CBI is investigating his role in other cases and identifying more victims who may have paid bribes. He faces charges under Prevention of Corruption Act.</p>
