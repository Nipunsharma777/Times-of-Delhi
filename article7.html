<h1>Investment Scam: Ponzi Scheme Mastermind Caught</h1>
<p><i>By Amit Verma | October 12, 2025 | 8:00 PM IST</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Economic Offences Wing arrested the mastermind behind a Rs 200 crore Ponzi scheme that duped thousands of investors across North India. The accused, Rajiv Malhotra, promised returns of 30% annually through his fake investment company.</p>
<p align="justify">Malhotra operated through a network of agents who recruited investors with promises of guaranteed high returns. The scheme collapsed when he failed to pay returns and investors filed complaints.</p>
<p align="justify">Investigation revealed that Malhotra used new investors' money to pay earlier investors, a classic Ponzi scheme pattern. He diverted crores to personal accounts and purchased luxury properties abroad.</p>
<p align="justify">"He lived a lavish lifestyle while investors lost their life savings," said Joint Commissioner EOW. "We have frozen his bank accounts and attached properties worth Rs 50 crores."</p>
<p align="justify">Over 5,000 investors have filed complaints. Police are working to recover funds and return money to victims. Malhotra faces charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust, and money laundering.</p>
