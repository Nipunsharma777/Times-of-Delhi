<p align="justify">Quick police action prevented a major bank robbery in Gurgaon. Four armed men were arrested while attempting to rob a nationalized bank branch in Sector 29. Police recovered weapons, masks, and tools used for breaking locks.</p>
<p align="justify">The incident occurred when bank security guard noticed suspicious activity outside the bank early morning. He immediately alerted police who reached the spot within minutes.</p>
<p align="justify">The robbers, armed with country-made pistols and knives, had planned to strike during opening hours when cash was being loaded into ATMs. They had been surveilling the bank for two weeks.</p>
<p align="justify">"Their plan was well-coordinated but our quick response foiled the attempt," said ACP Gurgaon. "No shots were fired and no one was injured."</p>
<p align="justify">All four accused have criminal records with previous cases of robbery and assault. They have been remanded to police custody for further interrogation about possible involvement in other crimes.</p>
