<h1>Major Cybercrime Ring Busted: 15 Arrested in Delhi Operation</h1>
<p><i>By Rajesh Kumar | October 13, 2025 | 9:30 AM IST</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Delhi Police's Cyber Crime Unit conducted a massive raid across multiple locations in the capital, busting a sophisticated cybercrime syndicate. The operation led to the arrest of 15 individuals involved in creating fake documents, identity theft, and online fraud worth over Rs 50 crores.</p>
<p align="justify">The accused were operating from rented apartments in South Delhi and had been targeting senior citizens and small business owners through phishing scams. Police recovered laptops, mobile phones, fake Aadhaar cards, and forged bank documents from the premises.</p>
<p align="justify">"This was a well-organized syndicate with connections across multiple states," said DCP Cyber Crime. "They used sophisticated techniques to create fake identities and siphon money from victims' bank accounts."</p>
<p align="justify">The investigation began three months ago after multiple complaints were filed by victims who lost lakhs of rupees. The cyber cell tracked the IP addresses and digital footprints of the accused, leading to their identification.</p>
<p align="justify">Among the arrested are two BTech graduates who were the technical masterminds behind the operation. They had created fake websites mimicking government portals and banking sites to steal personal information.</p>
<p align="justify">Police have urged citizens to be vigilant about online scams and never share OTPs, passwords, or personal information with unknown callers. The accused have been remanded to police custody for further interrogation.</p>
