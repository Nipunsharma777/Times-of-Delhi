<h1>Child Rescued Within 24 Hours of Abduction</h1>
<p><i>By Neha Patel | October 12, 2025 | 4:00 PM IST</i></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">Swift police action led to the rescue of a 7-year-old child and arrest of three kidnappers in Noida. The child was abducted from outside his school and rescued within 24 hours from a hideout in Greater Noida.</p>
<p align="justify">The kidnappers had demanded Rs 50 lakhs ransom from the child's businessman father. However, police tracked their location through mobile phone signals and conducted a midnight raid.</p>
<p align="justify">The child was found unharmed in a locked room. The three accused, identified as Deepak, Sunil, and Rahul, were arrested while trying to escape. They had planned the kidnapping for over a month.</p>
<p align="justify">"The child is safe and has been reunited with his family," said SP Noida. "We acted swiftly to ensure no harm came to the child."</p>
<p align="justify">One of the accused was a former employee of the victim's family who provided inside information. All three have been charged with kidnapping and criminal conspiracy. The family has thanked police for the quick rescue.</p>
